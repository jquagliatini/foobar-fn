I just wanted to create a sort-of Functional Kata.
It is just a regular exercice I do, to keep a clean
functional design in javascipt/typescript. I put the
project to its limits by implementing a lot of
subtypes and functions (the best may still be to come...).

It's based on a [Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)
style.
